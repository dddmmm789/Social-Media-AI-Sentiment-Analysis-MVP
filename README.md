# 🤖 My Sentiment Analysis Journey

🎯 I built this project to understand what it really means to train an AI model with my own hands. Turns out, you can create something useful with just 60 carefully chosen training sentences! However, it is not as sophisticated as RoBERTa, and you can play around with both to see the difference.

## 📦 What's Inside
- 🧠 A simple sentiment analyzer trained on basic examples (check them out in the app!)
- 🚀 Meta's RoBERTa model for comparison (the big guns!)
- 📊 Side-by-side comparison of both models
- 💻 Interactive web interface using Streamlit

## ✨ Why This is Cool
- 🎓 See how a tiny dataset (60 sentences) can create a working model
- 🌟 Compare it with Meta's advanced model trained on millions of tweets
- ⚖️ Understand the trade-offs between simple and complex models
- ⚡ Built in a few hours using [cursor.at](https://cursor.at)

## 🎯 Potential Uses
- 🛍️ Analyze product reviews
- 🎫 Process support tickets
- 📱 Monitor social media sentiment
- 🔄 ... and more with some tweaks!

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. 📥 Clone the repo
2. 📦 `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. 🎮 `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
4. 🎉 Start analyzing! 

## 💡 Learning Highlights
- 🎓 Training your own model is surprisingly accessible
- 📊 Small, focused datasets can be effective for specific use cases
- 🎨 Streamlit makes building AI demos super easy
- 🔍 The gap between simple and advanced models is fascinating

## 🔮 Next Steps
This is an MVP - feel free to:
- 📈 Add more training data
- 🎯 Adapt it for specific industries
- 🔄 Add features like batch processing
- 🧪 Experiment with different models

Built with ❤️ using Python, PyTorch, and Streamlit
